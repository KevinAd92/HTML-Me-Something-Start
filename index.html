            <h1>Saint Louis</h1>
            <p class = "funParagraph">
               This great midwestern city is the place I call home. With the Mississippi river running along our eastern boarder seperating Missouri from Illinois.
               In some of the recent years Saint Louis has taken great steps to improve the quailty of living for its population.
               With the lost of the St. Louis Rams NFL team the city has mangaged to recruit an XFL team the Battlehawks along with an MLS team St. Louis City FC.
               Through the dark times things get brighter, and the future for St. Louis looks as bright as ever.

               Someone once said St. Louis is a drinking city with a baseball problem. Two of St. Louis more well known entities are the St. Louis Cardinals and Anheuser busch. They come together perfectly at Busch Stadium home of St. louis's baseball team.
               Formerly home to the NBA team the St. Louis Spirits &amp; the NFLs St. Louis Rams. The city was in a bit of a hole when it comes to sports having only the MLB St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Blues of the NHL until recently where the city was able to acquire two new sports teams.

Then lastly Stil go the MLS St. Louis City FC team, who has inital success their first season but has since hit a sophomore slump the 2nd season around.
